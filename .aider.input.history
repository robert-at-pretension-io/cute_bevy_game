+Rigid-bodies
+The real-time simulation of rigid-bodies subjected to forces and contacts is the main feature of a physics engine for video-games, robotics, or animation. Rigid-bodies are typically used to simulate the dynamics of non-deformable solids as well as to integrate the trajectory of solids which velocities are controlled by the user (e.g. moving platforms). On the other hand, rigid-bodies are not enough to simulate, e.g., cars, ragdolls, or robotic systems, as those use-cases require adding restrictions on the relative motion between their parts using joints.
+
+Note that rigid-bodies are only responsible for the dynamics and kinematics of the solid. Colliders can be attached to a rigid-body to specify its shape and enable collision-detection. A rigid-body without collider attached to it will not be affected by contacts (because there is no shape to compute contact against).
+
+Creation and insertion
+A rigid-body is created by adding the RigidBody component to an entity. Other components like Transform, Velocity, Ccd, etc. can be added for further customization of the rigid-body.
+
+info
+The following example shows several initialization of components to customize rigid-body being built. The input values are just random so using this example as-is will not lead to a useful result.
+
+Example 2D
+Example 3D
+use bevy::prelude::*;
+use bevy_rapier2d::prelude::*;
+
+commands
+    .spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic)
+    .insert(TransformBundle::from(Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 5.0, 0.0)))
+    .insert(Velocity {
+        linvel: Vec2::new(1.0, 2.0),
+        angvel: 0.2,
+    })
+    .insert(GravityScale(0.5))
+    .insert(Sleeping::disabled())
+    .insert(Ccd::enabled());
+
+
+info
+Typically, the inertia and center of mass are automatically set to the inertia and center of mass resulting from the shapes of the colliders attached to the rigid-body. But they can also be set manually.
+
+Rigid-body type
+There are four types of rigid-bodies, identified by the RigidBody component:
+
+RigidBodyType::Dynamic: Indicates that the body is affected by external forces and contacts.
+RigidBodyType::Fixed: Indicates the body cannot move. It acts as if it has an infinite mass and will not be affected by any force. It will continue to collide with dynamic bodies but not with fixed nor with kinematic bodies. This is typically used for the ground or for temporarily freezing a body.
+RigidBodyType::KinematicPositionBased: Indicates that the body position must not be altered by the physics engine. The user is free to set its next position and the body velocity will be deduced at each update accordingly to ensure a realistic behavior of dynamic bodies in contact with it. This is typically used for moving platforms, elevators, etc.
+RigidBodyType::KinematicVelocityBased: Indicates that the body velocity must not be altered by the physics engine. The user is free to set its velocity and the next body position will be deduced at each update accordingly to ensure a realistic behavior of dynamic bodies in contact with it. This is typically used for moving platforms, elevators, etc.
+Both position-based and velocity-based kinematic bodies are mostly the same. Choosing between both is mostly a matter of preference between position-based control and velocity-based control.
+
+info
+The whole point of kinematic bodies is to let the user have total control over their trajectory. This means that kinematic bodies will simply ignore any contact force and go through walls and the ground. In other words: if you tell the kinematic to go somewhere, it will go there, no questions asked.
+
+Taking obstacles into account needs to be done manually either by using scene queries to detect nearby obstacles, or by using the built-in character controller.
+
+Position
+The position of a rigid-body represents its location (translation) in 2D or 3D world-space, as well as its orientation (rotation). stored in the standard Bevy Transform component.
+
+The position of a rigid-body can be set when creating it. It can also be set after its creation as illustrated below.
+
+warning
+Directly changing the position of a rigid-body is equivalent to teleporting it: this is a not a physically realistic action! Teleporting a dynamic or kinematic bodies may result in odd behaviors especially if it teleports into a space occupied by other objects. For dynamic bodies, forces, impulses, or velocity modification should be preferred. For kinematic bodies, see the discussion after the examples below.
+
+Example 2D
+Example 3D
+commands
+    .spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic)
+    .insert(TransformBundle::from(Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 5.0, 0.0)))
+
+
+/* Change the position inside of a system. */
+fn modify_body_translation(mut positions: Query<&mut Transform, With<RigidBody>>) {
+    for mut position in positions.iter_mut() {
+        position.translation.y += 0.1;
+    }
+}
+
+
+In order to move a dynamic rigid-body it is strongly discouraged to set its position directly as it may results in weird behaviors: it's as if the rigid-body teleports itself, which is a non-physical behavior. For dynamic bodies, it is recommended to either set its velocity or to apply forces or impulses.
+
+For velocity-based kinematic bodies, it is recommended to set its velocity instead of setting its position directly. For position-based kinematic bodies, it is recommended to modify its Transform (changing its velocity won’t have any effect). This will let the physics engine compute the fictitious velocity of the kinematic body for more realistic intersections with other rigid-bodies.
+
+Velocity
+The velocity of a dynamic rigid-body controls how fast it is moving in time. The velocity is applied at the center-of-mass of the rigid-body, and is composed of two independent parts:
+
+The linear velocity is specified as a vector representing the direction and magnitude of the movement.
+In 3D, the angular velocity is given as a vector representing the rotation axis multiplied by the rotation angular speed in rad/s (axis-angle representation). In 2D, the angular velocity is given as a real representing the angular speed in rad/s.
+info
+The velocity is only relevant to dynamic rigid-bodies. It has no effect on fixed rigid-bodies, and the velocity of kinematic rigid-bodies are automatically computed at each timestep based on their next kinematic positions.
+
+The velocity of a rigid-body is automatically updated by the physics pipeline after taking forces, contacts, and joints into account. It can be set when the rigid-body is created or after its creation:
+
+Example 2D
+Example 3D
+/* Set the velocities when the rigid-body is created. */
+commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).insert(Velocity {
+    linvel: Vec2::new(0.0, 2.0),
+    angvel: 0.4,
+});
+
+/* Set the velocities inside of a system. */
+fn modify_body_velocity(mut velocities: Query<&mut Velocity>) {
+    for mut vel in velocities.iter_mut() {
+        vel.linvel = Vec2::new(0.0, 2.0);
+        vel.angvel = 0.4;
+    }
+}
+
+
+Alternatively, the velocity of a dynamic rigid-body can be altered indirectly by applying a force or an impulse.
+
+Gravity
+Gravity is such a common force that it is implemented as a special case (even if it could easily be implemented by the user using force application). The gravity is given by the field RapierConfiguration::gravity of the resource RapierConfiguration and can be modified at will. Note however that a change of gravity won't automatically wake-up the sleeping bodies so keep in mind that you may want to wake them up manually before a gravity change.
+
+note
+Because fixed and kinematic bodies are immune to forces, they are not affected by gravity.
+
+info
+A rigid-body with no mass will not be affected by gravity either. So if your rigid-body doesn't fall when you expected it to, make sure it has a mass set explicitly, or has at least one collider with non-zero density attached to it.
+
+It is possible to change the way gravity affects a specific rigid-body by setting the rigid-body's gravity scale to a value other than 1.0. The magnitude of the gravity applied to this body will be multiplied by this scaling factor. Therefore, a gravity scale set to 0.0 will disable gravity for the rigid-body whereas a gravity scale set to 2.0 will make it twice as strong. A negative value will flip the direction of the gravity for this rigid-body.
+
+This gravity scale factor can be set when the rigid-body is created or after its creation:
+
+/* Set the gravity scale when the rigid-body is created. */
+commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).insert(GravityScale(2.0));
+
+/* Set the gravity scale inside of a system. */
+fn modify_body_gravity_scale(mut grav_scale: Query<&mut GravityScale>) {
+    for mut grav_scale in grav_scale.iter_mut() {
+        grav_scale.0 = 2.0;
+    }
+}
+
+
+Forces and impulses
+In addition to gravity, it is possible to add custom forces (or torques) or apply impulses (or torque impulses) to dynamic rigid-bodies in order to make them move in specific ways. Forces affect the rigid-body's acceleration whereas impulses affect the rigid-body's velocity. They are both based on the familiar equations:
+
+Forces: the acceleration change is equal to the force divided by the mass: 
+Δ
+a
+=
+m
+−
+1
+f
+Δa=m 
+−1
+ f
+Impulses: the velocity change is equal to the impulse divided by the mass: 
+Δ
+v
+=
+m
+−
+1
+i
+Δv=m 
+−1
+ i
+Forces can be added, and impulses can be applied, to a rigid-body when it is created or after its creation. Added forces are persistent across simulation steps, and can be cleared manually.
+
+Example 2D
+Example 3D
+commands
+    .spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic)
+    .insert(ExternalForce {
+        force: Vec2::new(1000.0, 2000.0),
+        torque: 140.0,
+    })
+    .insert(ExternalImpulse {
+        impulse: Vec2::new(100.0, 200.0),
+        torque_impulse: 14.0,
+    });
+
+/* Apply forces and impulses inside of a system. */
+fn apply_forces(
+    mut ext_forces: Query<&mut ExternalForce>,
+    mut ext_impulses: Query<&mut ExternalImpulse>,
+) {
+    // Apply forces.
+    for mut ext_force in ext_forces.iter_mut() {
+        ext_force.force = Vec2::new(1000.0, 2000.0);
+        ext_force.torque = 0.4;
+    }
+
+    // Apply impulses.
+    for mut ext_impulse in ext_impulses.iter_mut() {
+        ext_impulse.impulse = Vec2::new(100.0, 200.0);
+        ext_impulse.torque_impulse = 0.4;
+    }
+}
+
+info
+Keep in mind that a dynamic rigid-body with a zero mass won't be affected by a linear force/impulse, and a rigid-body with a zero angular inertia won't be affected by torques/torque impulses. So if your force doesn't appear to do anything, make sure that:
+
+The rigid-body is dynamic.
+It is strong enough to make the rigid-body move (try a very large value and see if it does something).
+The rigid-body has a non-zero mass or angular inertia either because they were set explicitly, or because they were computed automatically from colliders with non-zero densities.
+Mass properties
+The mass properties of a rigid-body is composed of three parts:
+
+The mass which determines the resistance of the rigid-body wrt. linear movements. A high mass implies that larger forces are needed to make the rigid-body translate.
+The angular inertia determines the resistance of the rigid-body wrt. the angular movements. A high angular inertia implies that larger torques are needed to make the rigid-body rotate.
+The center-of-mass determines relative to what points torques are applied to the rigid-body.
+note
+Zero is a special value for masses and angular inertia. A mass equal to zero is interpreted as an infinite mass. An angular inertia equal to zero is interpreted as an infinite angular inertia. Therefore, a rigid-body with a mass equal to zero will not be affected by any force, and a rigid-body with an angular inertia equal to zero will not be affected by any torque.
+
+Computing the mass and angular-inertia can often be difficult because they depend on the geometric shape of the object being simulated. This is why they are automatically computed by Rapier when a collider is attached to the rigid-body: the collider add its own mass and angular-inertia contribution (computed based on the collider's shape and density) to the rigid-body it is attached to:
+
+// When the collider is attached, the rigid-body's mass and angular
+// inertia will be automatically updated to take the collider into account.
+commands
+    .spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic)
+    .insert(Collider::ball(1.0))
+    // The default density is 1.0, we are setting 2.0 for this example.
+    .insert(ColliderMassProperties::Density(2.0));
+
+
+Alternatively, it is possible to set the mass properties of a rigid-body when it is created. Keep in mind that this won't prevent the colliders' contributions to be added to these values. So make sure to set the attached colliders' densities to zero if you want your explicit values to be the final mass-properties values.
+
+/* Set the additional mass properties when the rigid-body bundle is created. */
+commands
+    .spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic)
+    .insert(AdditionalMassProperties::Mass(10.0));
+
+
+/* Change the additional mass-properties inside of a system. */
+fn modify_body_mass_props(mut mprops: Query<&mut AdditionalMassProperties>) {
+    for mut mprops in mprops.iter_mut() {
+        *mprops = AdditionalMassProperties::Mass(100.0);
+    }
+}
+
+
+Locking translations/rotations
+It is sometimes useful to prevent a rigid-body from rotating or translating. One typical use-case for locking rotations is to prevent a player modeled as a dynamic rigid-body from tilting. These kind of degree-of-freedom restrictions could be achieved by joints, but locking translations/rotations of a single rigid-body wrt. the cartesian coordinate axes can be done in a much more efficient and numerically stable way. That's why rigid-bodies have dedicated flags for this.
+
+Example 2D
+Example 3D
+/* Lock translations and/or rotations when the rigid-body bundle is created. */
+commands
+    .spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic)
+    .insert(LockedAxes::TRANSLATION_LOCKED);
+
+
+/* Lock translations and/or rotations inside of a system. */
+fn modify_body_locked_flags(mut locked_axes: Query<&mut LockedAxes>) {
+    for mut locked_axes in locked_axes.iter_mut() {
+        *locked_axes = LockedAxes::ROTATION_LOCKED;
+    }
+}
+
+
+Damping
+Damping lets you slow down a rigid-body automatically. This can be used to achieve a wide variety of effects like fake air friction. Each rigid-body is given a linear damping coefficient (affecting its linear velocity) and an angular damping coefficient (affecting its angular velocity). Larger values of the damping coefficients lead to a stronger slow-downs. Their default values are 0.0 (no damping at all).
+
+This damping coefficients can be set when the rigid-body is created or after its creation:
+
+/* Set damping when the rigid-body bundle is created. */
+commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).insert(Damping {
+    linear_damping: 0.5,
+    angular_damping: 1.0,
+});
+
+/* Set damping inside of a system. */
+fn modify_body_damping(mut dampings: Query<&mut Damping>) {
+    for mut rb_damping in dampings.iter_mut() {
+        rb_damping.linear_damping = 0.5;
+        rb_damping.angular_damping = 1.0;
+    }
+}
+
+Dominance
+Dominance is a non-realistic, but sometimes useful, feature. It can be used to make one rigid-body immune to forces originating from contacts with some other bodies. For example this can be used to model a player represented as a dynamic rigid-body that cannot be "pushed back" by any, or some, other dynamic rigid-bodies part of the environment.
+
+Each rigid-body is part of a dominance group in [-127; 127] (the default group is 0). If the colliders from two rigid-bodies are in contact, the one with the highest dominance will act as if it has an infinite mass, making it immune to the contact forces the other body would apply on it. If both bodies are part of the same dominance group, then their contacts will work in the usual way (both are affected by opposite forces with the same magnitude).
+
+For example, if a dynamic body A is in the dominance group 10, and a dynamic body B in the dominance group -20, then a contact between a collider attached to A and a collider attached B will result in A remaining immobile and B being pushed by A (independently from their mass).
+
+info
+A non-dynamic rigid-body is always considered as being part of a dominance group greater than any dynamic rigid-body. This means that dynamic/fixed and dynamic/kinematic contacts will continue to work normally, independently from the dominance group they were given by the user.
+
+The dominance group can be set when the rigid-body is created or after its creation:
+
+/* Set dominance when the rigid-body bundle is created. */
+commands
+    .spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic)
+    .insert(Dominance::group(10));
+
+/* Set dominance inside of a system. */
+fn modify_body_dominance(mut dominances: Query<&mut Dominance>) {
+    for mut rb_dominance in dominances.iter_mut() {
+        rb_dominance.groups = 10;
+    }
+}
+
+
+Continuous collision detection
+Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) is used to make sure that fast-moving objects don't miss any contacts (a problem usually called tunneling). This is done by using motion-clamping, i.e., each fast-moving rigid-body with CCD enabled will be stopped at the time where their first contact happen, taking their continuous motion into account. This will result in some "time loss" for that rigid-body. This loss of time can be reduced by increasing the maximum number of CCD substeps executed (the default being 1) in the IntegrationParameters (by changing the RapierContext::integration_parameters::max_ccd_substeps field).
+
+Rapier implements nonlinear CCD, meaning that it takes into account both the angular and translational motion of the rigid-body.
+
+info
+CCD takes action only if the CCD-enabled rigid-body is moving fast relative to another rigid-body. Therefore it is useless to enable CCD on fixed rigid-bodies and rigid-bodies that are expected to move slowly.
+
+By default, CCD is disabled for all the rigid-bodies because it requires additional computations. It can be enabled when creating a rigid-body or after its creation:
+
+/* Enable CCD when the rigid-body bundle is created. */
+commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).insert(Ccd::enabled());
+
+/* Enable CCD inside of a system. */
+fn modify_body_ccd(mut ccds: Query<&mut Ccd>) {
+    for mut rb_ccd in ccds.iter_mut() {
+        rb_ccd.enabled = true;
+    }
+}
+
+Sleeping
+When a dynamic rigid-body doesn't move (or moves very slowly) during a few seconds, it will be marked as sleeping by the physics pipeline. Rigid-bodies marked as sleeping are no longer simulated by the physics engine until they are woken up. That way the physics engine doesn't waste any computational resources simulating objects that don't actually move. They are woken up automatically whenever another non-sleeping rigid-body starts interacting with them (either with a joint, or with one of its attached colliders generating contacts).
+
+When using the bevy_rapier plugin, rigid-bodies are also automatically woken up whenever one of the components of the rigid-body is modified (to apply forces, change its position, etc.) They will not be awaken automatically when changing the gravity though. So you may sometimes want to wake a rigid-body manually by setting the component field Sleeping::sleeping to true.

+To implement a settings menu in your Bevy game, we'll need to consider several aspects, including when and how the menu is accessed, what settings are available, how the settings affect the game, and how the user interacts with the menu. Here's a step-by-step plan:
+
+Extend the GameState Enum:
+
+First, we'll add a new variant to the GameState enum to represent the settings menu state.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+#[derive(States, Debug, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, Default)]
+enum GameState {
+    #[default]
+    Playing,
+    GameOver,
+    Win,
+    Settings, // New state for the settings menu
+}
+Create a Settings Resource:
+
+We'll define a Settings resource to hold all configurable parameters. This resource will be accessible throughout the game and will be updated when the user changes settings.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+#[derive(Resource)]
+struct Settings {
+    volume: f32,            // Volume level (0.0 to 1.0)
+    glow_intensity: f32,    // Glow effect intensity
+    pulse_magnitude: f32,   // Pulse effect magnitude
+    is_fullscreen: bool,    // Fullscreen toggle
+    // Add other settings as needed
+}
+
+impl Default for Settings {
+    fn default() -> Self {
+        Self {
+            volume: 0.5,
+            glow_intensity: 0.1,
+            pulse_magnitude: 0.03,
+            is_fullscreen: false,
+            // Initialize other settings with default values
+        }
+    }
+}
+Implement Input Handling to Open the Settings Menu:
+
+We'll allow the player to press the Escape key to open the settings menu. We'll create a system that listens for this keypress and transitions the game state accordingly.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn toggle_settings_menu(
+    keyboard_input: Res<Input<KeyCode>>,
+    mut next_state: ResMut<NextState<GameState>>,
+    current_state: Res<State<GameState>>,
+) {
+    if keyboard_input.just_pressed(KeyCode::Escape) {
+        match current_state.0 {
+            GameState::Playing => next_state.set(GameState::Settings),
+            GameState::Settings => next_state.set(GameState::Playing),
+            _ => {},
+        }
+    }
+}
+Pause the Game When in the Settings Menu:
+
+When the settings menu is open, we'll pause certain systems to prevent the game from updating.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+// In your main function, add a condition to systems that should be paused
+.add_systems(Update, (
+    // Systems to run only when not in the Settings state
+    spawn_ball.run_if(not(in_state(GameState::Settings))),
+    handle_ball_collisions.run_if(not(in_state(GameState::Settings))),
+    // ... other systems
+))
+Build the Settings Menu UI:
+
+We'll create UI components for the settings menu using Bevy's UI system. This includes sliders, buttons, and checkboxes.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn setup_settings_menu(
+    mut commands: Commands,
+    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
+    settings: Res<Settings>,
+) {
+    // Background panel
+    commands.spawn(NodeBundle {

+                    TextStyle {
+                        font: asset_server.load("fonts/FiraSans-Bold.ttf"),
+                        font_size: 20.0,
+                        color: Color::WHITE,
+                    },
+                ));
+            });
+        });
+    });
+}
+Implement Interaction Logic for the UI Components:
+
+We'll add systems to handle user interactions with the settings menu, updating the Settings resource accordingly.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn settings_menu_interaction(
+    mut settings: ResMut<Settings>,
+    mut slider_query: Query<(&Slider, &Parent)>,
+    mut button_query: Query<(&Interaction, &mut BackgroundColor, &Children), (Changed<Interaction>, With<Button>)>,
+    mut text_query: Query<&mut Text>,
+) {
+    // Handle sliders
+    for (slider, parent) in slider_query.iter_mut() {
+        let value = slider.value();
+        if let Ok(mut text) = text_query.get_mut(parent.get()) {
+            text.sections[0].value = format!("{:.2}", value);
+        }
+        // Update the settings based on slider values
+        // Match the parent to determine which setting to update
+        // ...
+    }
+
+    // Handle buttons
+    for (interaction, mut color, children) in button_query.iter_mut() {
+        match *interaction {
+            Interaction::Clicked => {
+                // Toggle fullscreen setting
+                settings.is_fullscreen = !settings.is_fullscreen;
+                *color = if settings.is_fullscreen {
+                    BackgroundColor(Color::GREEN)
+                } else {
+                    BackgroundColor(Color::RED)
+                };
+                // Update button text
+                if let Ok(mut text) = text_query.get_mut(children[0]) {
+                    text.sections[0].value = if settings.is_fullscreen { "On" } else { "Off" }.to_string();
+                }
+            },
+            Interaction::Hovered => {},
+            Interaction::None => {},
+        }
+    }
+}
+Apply Settings Changes to the Game:
+
+We'll update other resources and components in the game to reflect the changes made in the settings.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn apply_settings_changes(
+    settings: Res<Settings>,
+    mut visual_effects: ResMut<VisualEffects>,
+    mut audio: ResMut<Audio>,
+    mut windows: ResMut<Windows>,
+) {
+    // Update visual effects
+    visual_effects.glow_intensity = settings.glow_intensity;
+    visual_effects.pulse_magnitude = settings.pulse_magnitude;
+
+    // Update audio volume
+    audio.set_volume(settings.volume);
+
+    // Update window mode
+    if let Some(window) = windows.get_primary_mut() {
+        window.set_mode(if settings.is_fullscreen {
+            WindowMode::Fullscreen
+        } else {
+            WindowMode::Windowed
+        });
+    }
+}
+Ensure Cleanup When Exiting the Settings Menu:
+
+When the player exits the settings menu, we'll clean up the UI entities to prevent them from persisting in the game.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn cleanup_settings_menu(
+    mut commands: Commands,
+    query: Query<Entity, With<SettingsMenu>>,
+) {
+    for entity in query.iter() {
+        commands.entity(entity).despawn_recursive();
+    }
+}
+Add Systems to the App:
+
+Finally, we'll add the new systems to the Bevy app, making sure they run at the appropriate times and under the correct conditions.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn main() {
+    App::new()
+        // ... existing setup ...
+        .insert_resource(Settings::default())
+        .add_systems(Update, toggle_settings_menu)
+        .add_systems(OnEnter(GameState::Settings), setup_settings_menu)
+        .add_systems(Update, settings_menu_interaction.run_if(in_state(GameState::Settings)))
+        .add_systems(Update, apply_settings_changes)
+        .add_systems(OnExit(GameState::Settings), cleanup_settings_menu)
+        // ... rest of the app ...
+        .run();
+}
+Optional: Persist Settings Between Sessions:
+
+If you want the settings to persist between game sessions, you can implement saving and loading using serialization.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
+
+#[derive(Resource, Serialize, Deserialize)]
+struct Settings {
+    // ... fields ...
+}
+
+// Implement save and load functions using `serde_json` or another serialization library
+Summary:
+
+State Management: Introduce a new GameState::Settings variant to manage the settings menu state.
+Resource Definition: Create a Settings resource to store configurable parameters.
+UI Construction: Build the settings menu UI using Bevy's UI components, such as sliders and buttons.
+Input Handling: Implement systems to handle user input, updating the Settings resource based on interactions.
+Game Integration: Update other game resources and components to reflect changes in settings.
+Pause Mechanism: Pause the game when the settings menu is open by conditionally running systems.
+Cleanup: Ensure that UI elements are properly cleaned up when exiting the settings menu.
+Persistence (Optional): Implement saving and loading of settings to persist them across sessions.

+The error you're encountering is due to the misuse of the EntityCommands struct in Bevy. Specifically, the contains method doesn't exist on EntityCommands, which is why you're seeing the compiler error:
+
+plaintext
+Copy code
+error[E0599]: no method named `contains` found for struct `EntityCommands` in the current scope
+Understanding the Issue
+In your handle_ball_collisions function, you're attempting to check whether an entity has the DespawnTimer component by doing the following:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+if ball1.variant == ball2.variant 
+    && !commands.get_entity(e1).unwrap().contains::<DespawnTimer>()
+    && !commands.get_entity(e2).unwrap().contains::<DespawnTimer>()
+{
+    // Collision handling code
+}
+The commands.get_entity(e1) returns an Option<EntityCommands>, and EntityCommands is used for spawning and modifying entities, not for querying whether an entity has a particular component. This is why the contains method isn't found—it simply doesn't exist on EntityCommands.
+
+Solution
+To check if an entity has a specific component, you should use the query system provided by Bevy. Here's how you can modify your code to fix the error:
+
+Modify Your Query to Include Option<&DespawnTimer>:
+
+Update your query parameter in the handle_ball_collisions function to include Option<&DespawnTimer>. This allows you to check if each entity has the DespawnTimer component.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn handle_ball_collisions(
+    mut commands: Commands,
+    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
+    rapier_context: Res<RapierContext>, 
+    query: Query<(Entity, &Ball, &Transform, Option<&DespawnTimer>)>,
+    mut score_text_query: Query<&mut Text, With<ScoreText>>,
+    mut score: ResMut<Score>,
+    game_sounds: Res<GameSounds>,
+    mut next_state: ResMut<NextState<GameState>>,
+) {
+    // ... rest of the function ...
+}
+Update the Collision Handling Logic:
+
+Inside your collision handling loop, destructure the additional Option<&DespawnTimer> components and use them to determine whether to proceed with collision handling.
+
+rust
+Copy code
+if let (
+    Ok((e1, ball1, transform1, despawn_timer1)),
+    Ok((e2, ball2, transform2, despawn_timer2))
+) = (query.get(entity1), query.get(entity2)) {
+    if ball1.variant == ball2.variant 
+        && despawn_timer1.is_none()
+        && despawn_timer2.is_none()
+    {
+        // Proceed with collision handling
+    }
+}
+Here, despawn_timer1.is_none() checks if the first entity does not have a DespawnTimer component, and similarly for despawn_timer2.is_none().
+
+Why This Works
+By including Option<&DespawnTimer> in your query, you're effectively telling Bevy to try to fetch the DespawnTimer component for each entity if it exists. This way, you can check whether an entity has the component by checking if the Option is Some or None.
+
+Revised handle_ball_collisions Function
+Here's the updated function with the necessary changes:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn handle_ball_collisions(
+    mut commands: Commands,
+    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
+    rapier_context: Res<RapierContext>, 
+    query: Query<(Entity, &Ball, &Transform, Option<&DespawnTimer>)>,
+    mut score_text_query: Query<&mut Text, With<ScoreText>>,
+    mut score: ResMut<Score>,
+    game_sounds: Res<GameSounds>,
+    mut next_state: ResMut<NextState<GameState>>,
+) {
+    for pair in rapier_context.contact_pairs() {
+        let entity1 = pair.collider1();
+        let entity2 = pair.collider2();
+
+        if let (
+            Ok((e1, ball1, transform1, despawn_timer1)),
+            Ok((e2, ball2, transform2, despawn_timer2))
+        ) = (query.get(entity1), query.get(entity2)) {
+            if ball1.variant == ball2.variant 
+                && despawn_timer1.is_none()
+                && despawn_timer2.is_none()
+            {
+                let position = (transform1.translation + transform2.translation) / 2.0;
+                // Rest of your collision handling code...
+            }
+        }
+    }
+}
+Additional Notes
+Avoid Using unwrap() on Option<EntityCommands>:
+
+The commands.get_entity(entity) returns an Option<EntityCommands>. Using unwrap() without checking if it's Some can cause your program to panic if the entity doesn't exist, which is unsafe. However, in this context, even if you have the entity, EntityCommands doesn't provide a way to query components.
+
+Using Queries for Component Checks:
+
+Bevy's ECS (Entity Component System) design encourages the use of queries to access and check components. This approach is more efficient and aligns with Bevy's intended usage patterns.
+
+Avoiding Mutable Queries When Not Needed:
+
+Since you're only reading components, ensure your query doesn't request mutable access unless necessary. This can prevent potential data contention and borrowing issues.
+
+Summary
+Issue: Attempting to use contains on EntityCommands, which doesn't have such a method.
+Solution: Use Option<&Component> in your query to check if an entity has a specific component.
+Action: Modify your query and collision handling logic to include and check Option<&DespawnTimer>.
+Implementing the Fix
+After making the changes above, your code should compile without the no method named 'contains' error. This approach is more idiomatic in Bevy and leverages the ECS effectively.

+    |                     |
+    |                     arguments to this function are incorrect
+This error occurs because:
+
+The update_button_colors function expects a query of type Query<(&SettingButton, &mut BackgroundColor)>.
+You're passing interaction_query, which has the type Query<(&Interaction, &SettingButton, &mut BackgroundColor, &Children), Changed<Interaction>>.
+The types don't match, leading to the mismatched types error.
+Additionally, you're attempting to perform multiple mutable borrows of the same query in the same scope, which Rust's borrowing rules prohibit.
+
+Solution Overview
+To fix this, we'll:
+
+Use a Resource to Store the Selected Setting:
+Create a new resource SelectedEffectsSetting to keep track of the currently selected visual effects setting.
+Update the Resource When a Button Is Pressed:
+In the settings_menu_interaction function, update this resource when the user interacts with a visual effects button.
+Create a Separate System to Update Button Colors:
+Implement a new system update_button_colors that runs after settings_menu_interaction and updates the button colors based on the selected setting.
+Adjust System Ordering and Execution Conditions:
+Ensure that systems run in the correct order and under the appropriate game state.
+Step-by-Step Implementation
+1. Define the SelectedEffectsSetting Resource
+Add the following resource to your code:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+#[derive(Resource, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]
+struct SelectedEffectsSetting(SettingButton);
+2. Initialize the Resource in setup_settings_menu
+In your setup_settings_menu function, insert the resource after setting up the menu:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn setup_settings_menu(mut commands: Commands, settings: Res<Settings>) {
+    // ... existing code ...
+
+    // Insert the initial selected setting based on current settings
+    commands.insert_resource(SelectedEffectsSetting(get_current_effects_level(&settings)));
+}
+3. Update the Resource When a Button Is Pressed
+Modify your settings_menu_interaction function:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn settings_menu_interaction(
+    mut commands: Commands,
+    mut settings: ResMut<Settings>,
+    mut interaction_query: Query<
+        (&Interaction, &SettingButton, &mut BackgroundColor, &Children),
+        Changed<Interaction>,
+    >,
+    mut text_query: Query<&mut Text>,
+) {
+    for (interaction, button, mut color, children) in &mut interaction_query {
+        if *interaction == Interaction::Pressed {
+            match button {
+                SettingButton::SoundToggle => {
+                    // Existing code for toggling sound
+                }
+                SettingButton::LowEffects => {
+                    settings.glow_intensity = 0.02;
+                    settings.pulse_magnitude = 0.01;
+                    settings.color_speed = 0.05;
+                    // Update the selected setting resource
+                    commands.insert_resource(SelectedEffectsSetting(*button));
+                }
+                SettingButton::NormalEffects => {
+                    settings.glow_intensity = 0.05;
+                    settings.pulse_magnitude = 0.02;
+                    settings.color_speed = 0.1;
+                    // Update the selected setting resource
+                    commands.insert_resource(SelectedEffectsSetting(*button));
+                }
+                SettingButton::HighEffects => {
+                    settings.glow_intensity = 0.08;
+                    settings.pulse_magnitude = 0.03;
+                    settings.color_speed = 0.15;
+                    // Update the selected setting resource
+                    commands.insert_resource(SelectedEffectsSetting(*button));
+                }
+            }
+        }
+    }
+}
+4. Implement the update_button_colors System
+Create a new system that updates the button colors based on the selected setting:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn update_button_colors(
+    selected: Res<SelectedEffectsSetting>,
+    mut query: Query<(&SettingButton, &mut BackgroundColor)>,
+) {
+    for (button, mut color) in &mut query {
+        if matches!(button, SettingButton::LowEffects | SettingButton::NormalEffects | SettingButton::HighEffects) {
+            *color = if *button == selected.0 {
+                BackgroundColor(Color::srgb(0.2, 0.8, 0.2)) // Green for selected
+            } else {
+                BackgroundColor(Color::srgb(0.4, 0.4, 0.4)) // Gray for unselected
+            };
+        }
+    }
+}
+5. Adjust System Execution in the App
+Ensure that the new system runs at the appropriate time and game state:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn main() {
+    App::new()
+        // ... existing setup ...
+        .add_systems(Update, toggle_settings_menu)
+        .add_systems(OnEnter(GameState::Settings), setup_settings_menu)
+        .add_systems(Update, (
+            settings_menu_interaction,
+            apply_settings_changes,
+            update_button_colors, // Add this system
+        ).run_if(in_state(GameState::Settings)))
+        .add_systems(OnExit(GameState::Settings), cleanup_settings_menu)
+        // ... rest of the app ...
+        .run();
+}
+Explanation of Changes
+Resource Usage: By using SelectedEffectsSetting, we can share the selected setting between systems without violating Rust's borrowing rules.
+Separate Systems: Moving the color update logic to a separate system avoids multiple mutable borrows in the same scope.
+System Order: The update_button_colors system runs after settings_menu_interaction, ensuring it has the latest selected setting.
+Final Code Adjustments
+Here's how your settings_menu_interaction and update_button_colors functions should look:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn settings_menu_interaction(
+    mut commands: Commands,
+    mut settings: ResMut<Settings>,
+    mut interaction_query: Query<
+        (&Interaction, &SettingButton, &mut BackgroundColor, &Children),
+        Changed<Interaction>,
+    >,
+    mut text_query: Query<&mut Text>,
+) {
+    for (interaction, button, mut color, children) in &mut interaction_query {
+        if *interaction == Interaction::Pressed {
+            match button {
+                SettingButton::SoundToggle => {
+                    settings.sound_enabled = !settings.sound_enabled;
+                    *color = BackgroundColor(if settings.sound_enabled {
+                        Color::srgb(0.2, 0.8, 0.2)
+                    } else {
+                        Color::srgb(0.8, 0.2, 0.2)
+                    });
+                    if let Some(child) = children.first() {
+                        if let Ok(mut text) = text_query.get_mut(*child) {
+                            text.sections[0].value = if settings.sound_enabled {
+                                "Sound: ON".to_string()
+                            } else {
+                                "Sound: OFF".to_string()
+                            };
+                        }
+                    }
+                }
+                SettingButton::LowEffects | SettingButton::NormalEffects | SettingButton::HighEffects => {
+                    match button {
+                        SettingButton::LowEffects => {
+                            settings.glow_intensity = 0.02;
+                            settings.pulse_magnitude = 0.01;
+                            settings.color_speed = 0.05;
+                        }
+                        SettingButton::NormalEffects => {
+                            settings.glow_intensity = 0.05;
+                            settings.pulse_magnitude = 0.02;
+                            settings.color_speed = 0.1;
+                        }
+                        SettingButton::HighEffects => {
+                            settings.glow_intensity = 0.08;
+                            settings.pulse_magnitude = 0.03;
+                            settings.color_speed = 0.15;
+                        }
+                        _ => {}
+                    }
+                    commands.insert_resource(SelectedEffectsSetting(*button));
+                }
+            }
+        }
+    }
+}
+
+fn update_button_colors(
+    selected: Res<SelectedEffectsSetting>,
+    mut query: Query<(&SettingButton, &mut BackgroundColor)>,
+) {
+    for (button, mut color) in &mut query {
+        if matches!(button, SettingButton::LowEffects | SettingButton::NormalEffects | SettingButton::HighEffects) {
+            *color = if *button == selected.0 {
+                BackgroundColor(Color::srgb(0.2, 0.8, 0.2)) // Green for selected
+            } else {
+                BackgroundColor(Color::srgb(0.4, 0.4, 0.4)) // Gray for unselected
+            };
+        }
+    }
+}
+Testing the Changes
+After implementing these changes:
+
+Compile the Code: Ensure it compiles without errors.
+Run the Game: Test the settings menu by pressing Escape.
+Interact with Buttons: Click on the visual effects buttons and observe that the colors update correctly.
+Verify Settings Application: Ensure that the visual effects in the game reflect the selected settings.
+Summary
+Avoid Multiple Mutable Borrows: By separating the color update logic into its own system, we respect Rust's borrowing rules.
+Use Resources for Shared State: Resources allow different systems to communicate without direct dependencies.
+Leverage System Ordering: Bevy's system ordering ensures that systems run in a sequence that respects data dependencies.
+By making these adjustments, your code should compile successfully, and the settings menu will function as intended. If you have further questions or encounter additional issues, feel free to ask!

+To make the settings control more visual aspects of your game, we'll extend both the Settings and VisualEffects resources to include additional parameters. We'll also update the settings menu to allow the player to adjust these new settings interactively.
+
+Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:
+
+1. Identify Additional Visual Aspects to Control
+Let's consider the following visual aspects to control via the settings:
+
+Glow Speed: How quickly the balls' glow effect oscillates.
+Pulse Speed: The speed of the size pulsing effect on the balls.
+Background Animation Speed: How quickly the background colors change.
+Explosion Intensity: The number of particles and their behavior during explosions.
+Screen Shake Intensity: The intensity of the screen shake effect.
+2. Extend the Settings Struct
+First, we'll update the Settings struct to include new fields for these visual aspects:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+#[derive(Resource)]
+struct Settings {
+    volume: f32,
+    sound_enabled: bool,
+    glow_intensity: f32,
+    glow_speed: f32,
+    pulse_magnitude: f32,
+    pulse_speed: f32,
+    color_speed: f32,
+    background_animation_speed: f32,
+    explosion_intensity: f32,
+    screen_shake_intensity: f32,
+    is_fullscreen: bool,
+}
+Update the Default implementation accordingly:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+impl Default for Settings {
+    fn default() -> Self {
+        Self {
+            volume: 0.5,
+            sound_enabled: true,
+            glow_intensity: 0.05,
+            glow_speed: 0.5,
+            pulse_magnitude: 0.02,
+            pulse_speed: 0.4,
+            color_speed: 0.15,
+            background_animation_speed: 0.05,
+            explosion_intensity: 1.0,
+            screen_shake_intensity: 1.0,
+            is_fullscreen: false,
+        }
+    }
+}
+3. Update the VisualEffects Resource
+Next, we'll modify the VisualEffects struct to include the new parameters, and ensure it matches the Settings:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+#[derive(Resource)]
+struct VisualEffects {
+    glow_speed: f32,
+    color_speed: f32,
+    pulse_speed: f32,
+    glow_intensity: f32,
+    pulse_magnitude: f32,
+    background_animation_speed: f32,
+    explosion_intensity: f32,
+    screen_shake_intensity: f32,
+}
+Update the Default implementation:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+impl Default for VisualEffects {
+    fn default() -> Self {
+        Self {
+            glow_speed: 0.5,
+            color_speed: 0.15,
+            pulse_speed: 0.4,
+            glow_intensity: 0.05,
+            pulse_magnitude: 0.02,
+            background_animation_speed: 0.05,
+            explosion_intensity: 1.0,
+            screen_shake_intensity: 1.0,
+        }
+    }
+}
+4. Update the apply_settings_changes System
+Modify the apply_settings_changes function to apply the new settings:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn apply_settings_changes(
+    settings: Res<Settings>,
+    mut visual_effects: ResMut<VisualEffects>,
+) {
+    visual_effects.glow_intensity = settings.glow_intensity;
+    visual_effects.glow_speed = settings.glow_speed;
+    visual_effects.pulse_magnitude = settings.pulse_magnitude;
+    visual_effects.pulse_speed = settings.pulse_speed;
+    visual_effects.color_speed = settings.color_speed;
+    visual_effects.background_animation_speed = settings.background_animation_speed;
+    visual_effects.explosion_intensity = settings.explosion_intensity;
+    visual_effects.screen_shake_intensity = settings.screen_shake_intensity;
+}
+5. Modify Systems to Use New Visual Effects
+a. Update the Background Animation
+Modify the animate_background system to use background_animation_speed:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn animate_background(
+    time: Res<Time>,
+    mut strips: Query<(&mut Sprite, &mut BackgroundStrip)>,
+    effects: Res<VisualEffects>,
+) {
+    for (mut sprite, mut strip) in &mut strips {
+        // Update the hue based on visual effects settings
+        strip.hue += strip.speed * 360.0 * effects.background_animation_speed * time.delta_seconds();
+        if strip.hue > 360.0 {
+            strip.hue -= 360.0;
+        }
+        
+        // Update the color (hue in degrees)
+        sprite.color = Color::hsl(strip.hue, 1.0, 0.5);
+    }
+}
+b. Update Explosion Particles
+Modify the spawn_explosion function to use explosion_intensity:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn spawn_explosion(
+    commands: &mut Commands,
+    position: Vec3,
+    color: Color,
+    effects: &VisualEffects,
+) {
+    use rand::Rng;
+    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
+    
+    // Adjust the number of particles based on explosion intensity
+    let base_particles = 15.0;
+    let num_particles = (base_particles * effects.explosion_intensity) as u32;
+    
+    for _ in 0..num_particles {
+        // ... existing code ...
+    }
+}
+You'll also need to pass effects to spawn_explosion wherever it's called:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+spawn_explosion(&mut commands, position, explosion_color, &effects);
+c. Update Screen Shake
+Modify the update_screen_shake system to use screen_shake_intensity:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn update_screen_shake(
+    time: Res<Time>,
+    mut shake_state: ResMut<ScreenShakeState>,
+    mut camera_query: Query<&mut Transform, With<Camera>>,
+    effects: Res<VisualEffects>,
+) {
+    // ... existing code ...
+
+    // Scale shake intensity based on settings
+    let screen_scale = 8.0 * effects.screen_shake_intensity;
+
+    // ... use screen_scale as before ...
+}
+d. Update Ball Visual Effects
+Modify the update_ball_effects system to use glow_speed, pulse_speed, and color_speed from VisualEffects:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn update_ball_effects(
+    time: Res<Time>,
+    effects: Res<VisualEffects>,
+    mut query: Query<(&mut Ball, &mut Transform, &mut Sprite)>,
+) {
+    for (mut ball, mut transform, mut sprite) in query.iter_mut() {
+        // Update phases
+        ball.glow_phase += effects.glow_speed * time.delta_seconds();
+        ball.color_phase += effects.color_speed * time.delta_seconds();
+        ball.pulse_phase += effects.pulse_speed * time.delta_seconds();
+
+        // ... rest of the code ...
+    }
+}
+6. Update the Settings Menu
+a. Add Sliders for New Settings
+In your setup_settings_menu function, add sliders or buttons for the new settings. Here's an example of how to add sliders using Bevy UI components:
+
+First, add Bevy's UI components to your use statements:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+use bevy::ui::{FocusPolicy, Slider};
+Then, in the setup_settings_menu function, add sliders:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn setup_settings_menu(mut commands: Commands, settings: Res<Settings>) {
+    // ... existing code ...
+
+    // Visual Effects Sliders
+    parent.spawn(TextBundle::from_section(

+        settings.screen_shake_intensity,
+        SettingSlider::ScreenShakeIntensity,
+    );
+}
+You'll need to define the spawn_slider function to create sliders:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn spawn_slider(
+    commands: &mut Commands,
+    parent: &mut ChildBuilder,
+    label_text: &str,
+    value: f32,
+    slider_type: SettingSlider,
+) {
+    parent.spawn(NodeBundle {
+        style: Style {
+            flex_direction: FlexDirection::Row,
+            align_items: AlignItems::Center,
+            margin: UiRect::all(Val::Px(5.0)),
+            ..default()
+        },
+        ..default()
+    })
+    .with_children(|parent| {
+        // Label
+        parent.spawn(TextBundle::from_section(
+            label_text,
+            TextStyle {
+                font_size: 20.0,
+                color: Color::WHITE,
+                ..default()
+            },
+        ));
+
+        // Slider
+        parent.spawn((
+            SliderBundle {
+                style: Style {
+                    width: Val::Px(200.0),
+                    margin: UiRect::all(Val::Px(5.0)),
+                    ..default()
+                },
+                slider: Slider {
+                    value,
+                    min: 0.0,
+                    max: 1.0,
+                    ..default()
+                },
+                focus_policy: FocusPolicy::Pass,
+                ..default()
+            },
+            slider_type,
+        ));
+    });
+}
+b. Define SettingSlider Component
+Create an enum to identify each slider:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+#[derive(Component, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]
+enum SettingSlider {
+    GlowIntensity,
+    GlowSpeed,
+    PulseMagnitude,
+    PulseSpeed,
+    BackgroundAnimationSpeed,
+    ExplosionIntensity,
+    ScreenShakeIntensity,
+}
+c. Update settings_menu_interaction to Handle Sliders
+Modify settings_menu_interaction to handle slider changes:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+fn settings_menu_interaction(
+    mut settings: ResMut<Settings>,
+    mut interaction_query: Query<(
+        &Interaction,
+        Option<&SettingButton>,
+        Option<&SettingSlider>,
+        &mut BackgroundColor,
+        &Children,
+    ), Changed<Interaction>>,
+    mut slider_query: Query<&mut Slider>,
+    mut text_query: Query<&mut Text>,
+) {
+    for (interaction, button, slider, mut color, children) in &mut interaction_query {
+        if *interaction == Interaction::Pressed {
+            if let Some(button) = button {
+                match button {
+                    // ... existing button handling ...
+                }
+            }
+        }
+        // Handle sliders
+        if let Some(slider_type) = slider {
+            if let Some(child) = children.iter().find(|&c| slider_query.get(*c).is_ok()) {
+                if let Ok(mut slider) = slider_query.get_mut(*child) {
+                    let new_value = slider.value; // Get the updated slider value
+                    match slider_type {
+                        SettingSlider::GlowIntensity => settings.glow_intensity = new_value,
+                        SettingSlider::GlowSpeed => settings.glow_speed = new_value,
+                        SettingSlider::PulseMagnitude => settings.pulse_magnitude = new_value,
+                        SettingSlider::PulseSpeed => settings.pulse_speed = new_value,
+                        SettingSlider::BackgroundAnimationSpeed => settings.background_animation_speed = new_value,
+                        SettingSlider::ExplosionIntensity => settings.explosion_intensity = new_value,
+                        SettingSlider::ScreenShakeIntensity => settings.screen_shake_intensity = new_value,
+                    }
+                }
+            }
+        }
+    }
+}
+7. Adjust System Execution Order
+Ensure that apply_settings_changes runs after settings_menu_interaction:
+
+rust
+Copy code
+.add_systems(
+    Update,
+    (
+        settings_menu_interaction,
+        update_button_colors,
+        apply_settings_changes,
+    )
+    .chain()
+    .run_if(in_state(GameState::Settings)),
+)
+By chaining the systems, we enforce their execution order.
+
+8. Test and Fine-Tune
+Compile the Code: Ensure your code compiles without errors.
+Run the Game: Start the game and open the settings menu.
+Adjust Settings: Interact with the sliders and observe the changes in the game's visual effects.
+Fine-Tune Ranges: Adjust the min and max values of the sliders to achieve the desired effect ranges.
+Additional Notes
+Slider Ranges: You might need to adjust the ranges of the sliders to suit each setting. For example, glow_intensity might work best between 0.0 and 0.1, so you can set the max to 0.1 in the slider.
+Visual Feedback: Provide real-time feedback when adjusting settings. Ensure that changes take effect immediately so the player can see the impact.
+Persisting Settings: If you want to save settings between game sessions, consider implementing a saving mechanism to store settings to a file.
+By following these steps, you've extended the settings to control more visual aspects of the game, giving players greater control over their experience. This approach enhances the game's customization and can improve performance on lower-end devices by allowing users to reduce visual effects.
